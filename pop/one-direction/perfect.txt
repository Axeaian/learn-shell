I might never be your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious (oh, yeah)
Girl, I hope youâ€™re sure
What you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises
